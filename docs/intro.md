# Intro

Welcome to the **CodeScouts Library**. On this site, youâ€™ll find documentation about our libraries that allow you to implement [**Clean Architecture**](./clean-architecture) in Frontend development, currently with [**React**](https://reactjs.org/), although we are working to extend support to [**Svelte**](https://svelte.dev/) and [**VueJS**](https://vuejs.org/).

Our goal is to teach you how to implement it in **no more than 5 minutes**. Letâ€™s go ðŸš€

## Disclaimer

These libraries are continuously evolving. We follow [semantic versioning](https://semver.org/) to avoid breaking changes in your code, and we encourage you to report any issues you detect.

## Prerequisite Knowledge

As youâ€™re reading, these libraries enable you to implement clean architecture in your frontend, allowing you to test, maintain, and scale your software faster.

### Clean Architecture

If youâ€™re unfamiliar with **Clean Architecture** or would like to dive deeper into it, we recommend you first read this post [**Clean Architecture**](./clean-architecture) before proceeding.

## Letâ€™s Get Started

To implement our library, you have two options:

### Create a New Web App (React)

1. Install from the template

```bash
npx degit codescouts-academy/react-clean-architecture my-app
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Start the app

```bash
npm run dev
```

### Use Our Template (Create React App)

1. Install from the template

```bash
npx create-react-app my-app --template @codescouts/clean-architecture-template
```

2. Install dependencies

```bash
npm i
```

3. Start the app

```bash
npm start
```

If you use our template, youâ€™ll see something like this ðŸ‘‡
